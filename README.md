# Omnifood Website - Practice Project using HTML and CSS

This repository contains a practise project for building the Omnifood website using HTML and CSS. This project showcases the features of Omnifood, a technology-driven healthy meal delivery service, including a personalized meal planner run by AI. It was created solely for practise purposes to enhance HTML and CSS skills.

## Features

- Responsive design for various devices and screen sizes.
- Intuitive user interface with a custom meal planner.
- Sample meals categorized for different diets (vegetarian, vegan, etc.).
- Pricing plans, customer testimonials, and contact information.

## Project Description

This project is a part of my ongoing learning journey in web development. It serves as a hands-on exercise to improve my frontend design and development skills using HTML and CSS. The primary goal is to create a visually appealing and functional website for a fictional healthy meal delivery service called Omnifood.

Please note that this project is a frontend-only implementation and does not include backend functionality. It is designed to simulate a user-friendly interface, allowing users to explore sample meals, view pricing plans, and read customer testimonials. However, it does not perform any actual meal delivery services.
